# ruby_spice
Learning ruby by creating a program to add or delete Spice Girls from the band, including changing names, skills, and nicknames.
First attempt at ruby having only been briefly exposed to C++ in the early 2000s....and it's deeply ordinary code.
redoing/refactoring the code to fit a more test based development model using rspec tooling. I intend to work on this to create a 
little app.
I don't even much like the spice girls.
